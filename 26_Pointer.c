// Pointer is a Variable which stores the address of another variable.
// int a = 5; //that means m percent of a(&a) is &a. Address of a.
// The address of operator '&' RETURNS THE ADDRESS OF A VARIABLE
// '*' is the dereference operator (also called indirection operator) USED TO
// GET THE VALUE AT A GIVEN ADDRESS

// for example: scanf takes the address, stores a value of variable
